- /Scenarios/update_scenario/{scenario_id}
- Do we only call this once for a scenario?
- Is the speed factor only relevant for the frontend?


------

- Update multiple times
- Delete request body before sending
-


Basically:
- Always fetch /Scenarios/get_scenario/{scenario_id} to see which is available, until scenario is done
-
